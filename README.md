# a blog
This is the repository for my github pages blog.

I first read Edward Tufte's *Envisaging Information* about twenty years or so ago. At the time it was a revalation to me; much of the print and online design I saw in the late 1990s and early 2000s was appalling in terms of conveying information. Lessons from hundreds of years of bookdesign and typesetting were being ignored.

When I thought I should get round to doing a blog, I wanted to to it in his style. Fortunately for me, someone had already applied the [Edward Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) to a Jekyll blog I could use on github pages. I copied this from https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll.
